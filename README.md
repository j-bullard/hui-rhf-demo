# Headless UI with React Hook Form Demo

App showing how to connect headless-ui controls with react-hook-form. The current setup using `<Controller />` component from RHF keeps track of state. There is an issue below that I need to resolve but this will hopefully get you in the right direction.

## TODO

- Fix issue with state between HUI and RHF
