# Headless UI with React Hook Form Demo

App showing how to connect headless-ui controls with react-hook-form. The current setup using `<Controller />` component from RHF keeps track of state. There is an issue below that I need to resolve that headless-ui does not show the default value as being selected.

## TODO

- [x] Fix issue with state between HUI and RHF
- [ ] Fix headless-ui not setting "active" styling
